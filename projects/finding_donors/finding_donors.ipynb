    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdaBoost Classifier\n",
    "The AdaBoost is a powerful classification algorithm that belongs to the family of Ensemble methods, it uses an iterative process that combines the output of a series of \"weak\" learners to greatly improve the overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AdaBoost has many application from [face detection](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jcorso/t/CSE555/files/lecture_boosting.pdf) to [traffic flow management](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.360.625&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and has been widely used in may Kaggle competitions.\n",
    "* AdaBoost is a very powerful non-linear classifier, it iteratively trains weak learners tweaking them in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. The individual learners can be very weak, and as long as the performance of each one is slightly better than random guessing, the final model can be proven to converge to a strong learner[[6]].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost).\n",
    "* However AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers and it is relatively slow to train compared to other algorithms so for both reasons it can benefit from dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "* I have chosen AdaBoost because is a powerful classification algorithm which performs well with multiple features and can handle data inbalances. Also the dataset is relatively small and the fact that the model is relatively slow to train in this case is not a cause of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is another powerful classification algorithm that belong to the family of Ensemble methods, it is similar to the AdaBoost as it is an ensamble of weak learners, however subsequent learners are fit to the residual of previous learners rather than to the feature themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gradient Boosting is used in the field of [learning to rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank), recommender systems and is one of the winning algorithms used in many [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-10-gradient-boosting)\n",
    "* Gradient Boosting is a very powerful non-linear classifier and regression model that can learn complex non-linear decision boundaries via boosting. \n",
    "* Gradient boosting is a greedy algorithm and can overfit a training dataset quickly [[10]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/) so it will benefit from regularisation. Also it is relatively slow to train compared to other algorithms.\n",
    "* I have chosen Gradient Boosting as my second classifier because is also a very powerful classification algorithm which performs well with multiple features and can handle data inbalances. Also the dataset is relatively small and the fact that the model is relatively slow to train in this case is not a cause of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is an important linear ML algorithm aimed to model the probability of a random variable Y being 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression is widely used in various fields like medical fields and social sciences. For example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) is widely used to [predict mortality in injured patients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) .\n",
    "* Logistic Regression if fairly simple and is very fast to train predict.\n",
    "* Logistic Regression is a linear model and as such will fit poorly non-linear data.\n",
    "* I have choosen Logist Regression as my third algorithm because it is a simple and fast to train model. Logist Regression requires features to be normalised which is something we have done and adds to the reason to use also this model. Also I will use Logistic Regression as a benchmark against which I can compare the other two more complex and slower algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Gradient Boosting** is the best performing model (even if so only marginally compared to AdaBoost) out of the three in terms of Accuracy and FBeta-Score. On the full test set, it has an accuracy of 86% and an FBeta-Score of 74%, AdaBoost has an accuracy of 86% and FBeta-Score of 72% while the Logistic Regression an accuracy of 84% and FBeta-Score of 68%.\n",

    "\n",
    "However Gradient Boosting once trained is fairly fast at predicting taking only 0.02 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph **F-score on Training subset** we can see how the F-score decreses as the training data increases, this trend suggests as the models is trained with bigger dataset it also generalises better and there is less overfitting, this is confirmed by comparing the other graph **F-score on Testing Set** where F-score on unseen data increases as more data is used for the training.\n",
    "\n",

    "The F-score, also known as FBeta-Score, was initialised with beta = 0.5 to give more relevance to precision, in other words we have preferred a Type 2 (False negative) error over a Type 1 error (False positives). This is because it is less important for the charity to send a letter to every individuals earning above \\$50,000 (High Recall) than being more selective (High Precision) and accurately sending letters to only individuals whose earnings are more likely above \\$50,000 reducing the risk of paying for communication to individual that are less likely to donate."

    "Gradient Boosting is a Machine Learning model belonging to the family of Ensemble models. \n",
    "\n",
    "These type of models draw their strength by employing a number of learners, called 'weak' learners to **build an overall stronger learner as opposed to relying on a single model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting in our case starts with building a Decision Tree, this can be thought as a kind of big nested tree of If - Else conditions (a series of questions regarding the features) based on which it tries to predict whether the individual earns more or less than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could define the \"correctness\" of this big decision tree in terms of error, in other words **how far off are the predictions from the correct answer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting algorithm reasons along these lines - if it knew the **error** amount it could adjust the decision tree so that its predictions were _corrected_ by this error amount, and so it does, it tries to find out what that error is, but how? \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will train a second model that tries to predict the initial decision tree error. This second model will itself have a certain amount of error. So the algorithm will train yet another model to learn the error of the second model. Also these predictions will contain a certain amount of error and so the algorithm will train another model and then another model up to a certain specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the error predictions are then used to adjust the previous model prediction up to eventually adjusting the error of the initial Decision Tree with the learned error quantity.\n",

Most likely such individuals are among the higher earners brackets if they have the means to invest their money.\n",
    "3. **marital status:** I did not believe marital status did have an effect on income. I would not know how to explain such correlation but the fact that being married is also correlated with age and age has a positive correlation to salary.\n",
    "4. **age:** I did predict age in the same ordinal position, age, as stated above, has a strong positive correlation with salary, salaries tend to increase with age. Additionally, married people might have a family with children and therefore additional cost, which might push individuals to seek higher paid jobs.\n",
    "5. **education:** Highly educated individuals tend to have higher paid job compared to individuals with lower education as I anticipated in my initial prediction, however I thought education were more highly correlated to salary than some other features."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
